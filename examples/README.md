MasterMSM examples
==================
Here are a set of examples where you can learn some of the fundamentals of
the MasterMSM package. They correspond to either model systems (dynamics 
on one or two dimensional potentials) or molecular dynamics simulations
on simple biomolecules. 

Contents
--------
* brownian_dynamics_1D: example corresponding to a one-dimensional two-state model.
* alanine_pentapeptide: example with true MD simulation data, generated with the Gromacs package.
