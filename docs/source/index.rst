==========================================
Welcome to MasterMSM's documentation!
==========================================

MasterMSM is a Python package for generating Markov state models (MSMs)
from molecular dynamics trajectories. We use a formulation based on 
the chemical master equation. This package will allow you to:

* Create Markov state / master equation models from biomolecular simulations.
* Discretize trajectory data using dihedral angle based methods useful
  for small peptides.
* Calculate rate matrices using a variety of methods.
* Obtain committors and reactive fluxes.
* Carry out sensitivity analysis of networks.

Development and Installation 
----------------------------
The MasterMSM code is hosted in Github at 
`https://github.com/daviddesancho/MasterMSM <https://github.com/daviddesancho/MasterMSM`_.
Active development of the MasterMSM code takes place using the git version control
system.
