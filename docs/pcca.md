# Clustering the MSM
For now in MasterMSM there is only one approach for clustering the microscopic 
MSM into a macrostate model. Here we borrow the methods described by Buchete 
and Hummer to build macrostates based on the sign or distribution of the 
eigenvector values.

As they stated in their paper, this approach is a version of Perron clustering
(i.e. PCCA). On top of the methods described in the reference above, and 
following work by [Chodera et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2714538) we 
include an optimization step in the clustering. This way, there is some chance 
that imperfections in the initial, eigenvector-based clustering, will be overcome. 
The optimization is a Monte Carlo simulated annealing procedure where the
 metastability plays the role of the energy and we use a simple temperature scheme.
