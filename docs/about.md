# About

My name is [David De Sancho](https://sites.google.com/site/daviddesanchores/home)
and currently I am an Ikerbasque Research Fellow at 
[nanoGUNE](http://www.nanogune.eu). Over the last few years of work as a postdoc
in the laboratory of [Robert B. Best](http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/best/home.html) 
I have extensively used master equation / Markov state models (usually termed
MSMs) to analyze data from molecular dynamics simulations. My work is heavily 
indebted to massive contributions from other groups. So before you get any further
I would suggest reading the following volume

* [An Introduction to Markov State Models and Their Application to Long Timescale
Molecular Simulation](<http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-7606-7>), edited 
by Pande, Bowman and Noe. 

It surely contains all you need to know about this methodology. 

However, there is a gradually increasing number of papers where we have used our
 own flavour of MSMs, and we have even made some small methodological contributions.

* [What is the time scale for alpha-helix
 nucleation?](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja200834s) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133 (17), 
6809-6816 (2011).

simulation](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ct301033r). J. Chem. Theory Comput. 9 (3) 1743-1753 (2013)

lambda-Repressor](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp405904g) J. Phys. Chem. B 117

rates](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5307) Nat. Commun. 5 (2014).

 Myoglobin](http://dx.doi.org/10.0.3.253/ct5011455) J. Chem. Theory Comput. 1549-9618 (2015).


At some point it became evident that it would be a good idea to make my own code 
open, version controlled, tested and well documented.
